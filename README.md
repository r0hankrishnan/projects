## Python
| Project Link | Area | Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 🛍️ [Retail Analysis](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/retail_analysis) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Cluster Analysis, Dashboarding | Using retail data from a UK online store, conducted data cleaning & feature engineering before using visualizations KMeans clustering to extract business insights about the store's various customer segments. Also created a simple streamlit dashboard to explore the store's sales by country. | pandas, numpy, pyperclip, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, streamlit |
| 🚗 [CarMax Analytics](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/carmax) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Predictive Modelling, Dimensionality Reduction | Using CarMax trade-in data from the **CarMax Analytics Case Competition**, conducted data cleaning & feature engineering before using visualizations and hypothesis testing to extract business insights about the CarMax trade-in process. Also created a random forest model to predict a traded-in car's value and used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. | pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, prince, streamlit |
| 🏈 [NFL Playoff Predictor](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/nfl)| Data Collection, Data Wrangling & EDA, Predictive Modelling | Using self-collected data on the characteristics of NFL teams that make the playoffs, create visualizations, analyses, and predictive models with the goal of predicting a team's chance of making the playoffs based on their regular season performance. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, jupyter notebooks, streamlit |

## R

|--------------|------|-------------|------------|
| 🏠 [US Housing Analysis](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/us-housing-analysis) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Predicitve Modelling & Fine-Tuning, Reporting | Conducted an analysis of the US housing market by combining and analyzing three datasets from Kaggle.com. Created several machine learning models to predict housing price index and to used clustering techniques to further explore the data. Created simple R shiny dashboard to visualize clustering.| dplyr, ggplot2, kable, MASS, broom, modelr, purr, rpart, randomForest, caret, factoextra, cluster, Rshiny |
| 🎸 [Song Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/song-popularity) | Data Cleaning, EDA,  Predictive Modelling & Fine-Tuning, Dashboarding | Used R to clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset of 1200 songs with 19 characteristics. Tested several models to find which best predicted a song's popularity. Also used RShiny to create a song popularity prediction dashboard. | dplyr,  ggplot2, felm, gbm, randomForest, broom, Rshiny, leaps, glmnet |
| 💰 [Econometrics II: Advanced Methods Paper Recreations](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan?tab=repositories) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Econometric Modeling, Report Generation | Recreated 6 published microeconomic research papers using official data and R | dplyr, stargazer, ggplot2, felm |
